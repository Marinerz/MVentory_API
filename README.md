===========



## Installation

##### jQuery conflict
This extension may fail to install if another mVentory extension is already installed because they use the same jQuery library from the same location.

`CONNECT ERROR: Package file is invalid './js/jquery/jquery-min.js' already exists`

You can delete the existing file and re-try the installation.
