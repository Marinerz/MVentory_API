You can manage [finer details](https://github.com/mVentory/MVentory_Tm/wiki/User-configuration) of the user access on `SOAP/XML/RPC - Users` page. 

####Attributes

Magento has many product attributes, but only a few of them are used for product management. The app shows a few basic attributes by default: 
* Price
* Weight
* SKU
* Qty
* Name
* Description 

Add an `_` (underscore) to the attribute code on attribute details page to inclkude it in the product details for the app. Existing attributes can have the underscore added / removed by pressing on `Add/Remove to mVentory` button.

Note, changing an attribute code requires refreshing Magento indexes.

Attrbute code examples that are recognised by the app: `cpu_frequency_`, `age_`, `not_a_useful_attribute_`
Ignored by the app: `cpu_frequency`, `age`, `not_a_useful_attribute`

Certain attributes are created by the extension and are reserved.

mVentory has many special feature for manupulating attributes and their values. Read more on https://github.com/mVentory/MVentory_Tm/wiki/Attribute-features

####Category mapping
The app does not allow the user to choose the category of the product. Instead, the categories are mapped based on product properties.

Open an attribute set and scroll down to `Category Matching section`.

1. Create a default mapping rule by selecting a category and saving the rule. Any product from this attribute set will be placed under the selected category.
2. Create individual rules by selecting attributes and their values from the dropdowns and mapping them to categories on the right.

mVentory extension evaluates attributes from top down. The first matching rule is applied. You can drag saved rule blocks up and down to arrange them from the most specific at the top to the most generic at the bottom.

* Multiple values of the same attribute are combined using OR operand.
* Multiple attributes are combined using AND operand.
* Used attribute and values are greyed out, but can be used as many times as needed.
